        <h1>Scrumble overview</h1>
            Scrumble is a proof-of-concept Scrum-tracking app.
            It is not intended to be full-featured, but could be useful to someone learning JavaFX.
            It is written in JavaFX,
            and incorporates parsing of user-entered commands with database calls
            and tabular display of the resulting data.

        <h1>Getting started</h1>
            Scrumble is written in JavaFX using NetBeans.
            To run properly, it requires a database to first be set up with certain tables.
            The DDL for these tables can be found in /resources/scrumble_ddl.sql.
            <br/><br/>
            There is also a small amount of test data in the file /resources/scrumble_test_data.sql.
            
        <h1>Scrumble commands</h1>
        (Commands that are not yet supported are <strike>struck out</strike>.)
        <ul>
%%COMMANDS%%
        </ul>

        <h1>Main potential directions of improvement</h1>
        <h2> Functionality changes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Completion of currently unsupported commands. </li>
            <li> Support for charts&mdash;primarily burndown charts. </li>
            <li> Support for editing data directly in the displayed tables. </li>
            <li> Add a back button to the Help window. </li>
            <li> Formation of a programmatic interface, using REST.
                <ul>
                    <li> URL components could be derived from the "signature" field in UserCmdTypeInfo. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Other changes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Execute SQL commands in a separate thread from the UI.
            <li> Improve test data (see /resources/scrumble_test_data.sql) </li>
            <li> Adopt one or more tools to modify the design of service calls or data binding.
